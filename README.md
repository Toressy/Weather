![Screen Recording 2025-09-30 at 18 28 47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1a5c074-6148-40be-97e4-c51dcd2ed492)


This document outlines the technical skills and processes used to develop a dynamic, single-screen weather dashboard built on **Power BI**. The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from **API data acquisition** to advanced **data visualization**.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of real-time current weather conditions, a multi-day forecast, air quality metrics, and essential atmospheric details for **Nottingham, London, Glasgow, Birmingham or Manchester**.

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features & Metrics

The dashboard is structured into several key components to provide a full weather picture:

* **Current Conditions:** Real-time temperature ($\mathbf{17.1\,^\circ C}$), weather summary ($\mathbf{Partly\, cloudy}$), and last updated timestamp.
* **Atmospheric Detail:** Card-based metrics for $\mathbf{Humidity}$ ($\mathbf{55}$), $\mathbf{Wind\, Speed}$ ($\mathbf{2.2\, mph}$), $\mathbf{Pressure}$ ($\mathbf{30.27}$), and $\mathbf{UV\, Index}$.
* **Forecast Weather:** A 7-day temperature trend line chart, allowing quick assessment of upcoming temperature fluctuations.
* **Air Quality Index (AQI):** A detailed breakdown of key pollutants ($\text{CO}$, $\text{PM10}$, $\text{NO}_2$, $\text{PM2.5}$, $\text{O}_3$, $\text{SO}_2$) alongside a visual gauge for the overall health risk classification.
* **Precipitation:** Weekly percentage forecast displayed in clear horizontal bar charts for immediate day-by-day comparison of the **Chance of Rain**.
